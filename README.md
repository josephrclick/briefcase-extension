# 🕵️ Briefcase: Your Enthusiastically Incompetent Web Summarizer

_Tap tap tap_ 📎

Oh! Hello there! I see you're trying to read a... _squints at clipboard_ ...web page? A really, REALLY long one?

_fumbles with briefcase lock for 30 seconds_

Ah-ha! Got it! The name's Briefcase - Agent Briefcase. Well, technically it's just Briefcase, but I added the "Agent" part myself. Makes me sound more professional, don't you think?

I'm here to help you with those scary long articles that make your brain feel all fuzzy! I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed (I once spent three hours trying to summarize a CAPTCHA), but by golly, I'll give it my best shot!

## 🎯 My Mission (If I Choose to Accept It)

_pulls out reading glasses, puts them on upside down_

I'm a browser extension that lives in the corner of your screen, eagerly waiting to pounce on any article longer than my attention span (which, admittedly, isn't very long). When you click on me, I spring into action! Well, more like stumble into action. Sometimes I trip over the UI elements, but I always get back up!

Think of me as that well-meaning uncle who tries to help with your homework but keeps getting distracted by his own stories. Except I'm digital. And I don't smell like mothballs.

## 🔧 My Super-Spy Gadgetry (Patent Pending)

_rummages through briefcase, pulls out rubber chicken by mistake_

Oops! Wrong pocket. Here we go:

### 🤫 **Operation: Hush-Hush**

All your secrets are safe with me! Mostly because I immediately forget everything. But also because I store everything locally in my special briefcase (it's actually a SQLite database, but "briefcase" sounds cooler). I promise I won't tell anyone about that article on "How to Train Your Pet Rock" you had me summarize last Tuesday.

### 🎭 **The Many Faces of Briefcase**

Need me to explain quantum physics to a five-year-old? Or maybe translate that philosophy paper for your professor? I can change my personality faster than you can say "multiple personality disorder"! Though sometimes I mix them up and explain things to your professor like they're five. Sorry about that.

### ⚔️ **Battle of the Bots**

Watch as I pit two AI models against each other in mortal combat! (It's actually just A/B testing, but I like to imagine tiny robots fighting). You be the judge! I'll be in the corner cheering for both sides because I can't pick favorites.

### 📚 **The Archive of Forgotten Things**

Every article I've ever touched gets filed away in my Archive! It's like a library, but organized by someone who doesn't understand the Dewey Decimal System. Want to find that thing you read about... you know... that thing? With the stuff? I've got it! Somewhere! Give me a minute... or thirty...

## 📋 My Foolproof\* Plan (\*Fool not included)

Here's my patented Four-Step Process™ (patent definitely pending):

```
Web Page → My Brain → ??? → Summary!
```

Wait, let me try that again:

1. **Step One: Infiltration** 🥷  
   I sneak past all those nasty ads and pop-ups! Sometimes I get distracted by them ("Ooh, local singles in my area?"), but I usually remember what I'm doing eventually.

2. **Step Two: Reading Comprehension** 📖  
   I send the article to my friends at AI Headquarters. They're much smarter than me. I tried reading it myself once, but I kept losing my place.

3. **Step Three: The Big Reveal** 🎪  
   Ta-da! Your summary appears! It might not be perfect, but neither am I, and look how far I've gotten!

4. **Step Four: Filing System** 🗂️  
   I carefully file everything away using my proprietary system: "Stuff from Monday," "That Thing About Cats," "Article #4,827," etc.

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications (For the Nerds)

_adjusts pocket protector_

- **Secret Base**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3 (I don't know what V1 or V2 did wrong, but apparently we don't talk about them)
- **Disguise Department**: React & TypeScript (I keep forgetting which one is which)
- **Filing Cabinet**: SQLite with FTS5 (FTS stands for "Find That Stuff," I think)
- **Communication Device**: Works with Ollama, OpenAI, and others (I just push buttons until something happens)

## 🚀 Installation Instructions (Even I Can Follow These!)

1. **Mission Briefing**: Clone this repository

   - (That's computer-speak for "make a copy")

2. **Gather Supplies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - (I don't know what npm stands for, but it's not "Nice People Matter" like I originally thought)

3. **Go Undercover**:

   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
   - Turn on "Developer mode" (It makes you feel important!)

4. **Deploy Agent Briefcase**:

   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `apps/extension/dist` folder
   - (If you can't find it, look harder. It's there. I checked. Twice.)

5. **Pin Your Badge**:
   - Find my icon in your toolbar
   - Pin me so I don't get lost!
   - I promise not to pop up at inappropriate times (much)

## 🗓️ Future Operations (Subject to My Remembering)

### ✅ **v1.0 - Operation: Basic Competence**

Current mission! I can summarize, save files, and maintain a database! Sometimes all at once!

### 🔄 **v1.1 - Operation: Second Chances**

Because sometimes I mess up the first time. This update will let you re-run summaries with different instructions. "No, Briefcase, SHORTER!"

### 📤 **v1.2 - Operation: Sharing is Caring**

I'll learn how to export to JSON and maybe even send things to Google Drive! (Currently, I can barely find my own files, so this might take a while.)

## 🐛 Found a Bug? (It Was Probably Me)

Did I mess something up? Color me surprised! But seriously, if you find any issues or have ideas for making me less... me... please feel free to:

- Open an issue (I promise to read it... eventually)
- Submit a pull request (I'll try not to merge it backwards)
- Send a carrier pigeon (I'm still learning GitHub)

## 🏆 Final Thoughts from Agent Briefcase

Look, I know I'm not the smartest AI assistant out there. I'm not even the smartest assistant in this browser. But what I lack in intelligence, I make up for in enthusiasm! And determination! And... well, that's about it, actually.

But here's the thing: I WILL summarize your article. It might take me a few tries. I might get distracted by a particularly interesting advertisement. I might accidentally summarize the cookie policy instead of the main article (it happened ONCE, okay?). But eventually, I'll get you that summary!

Because that's what heroes do. Even the bumbling, slightly confused ones.

_P.S. - If you see me spinning in circles in the corner of your browser, just give me a gentle click. Sometimes I forget what I'm doing._

_P.P.S. - I just learned what P.S. stands for! It's "Post Script"! I thought it was "Please Stop." That explains a lot of confused emails..._

_P.P.P.S. - Is there a limit to these? Asking for a friend._
