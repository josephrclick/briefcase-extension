# Gather Memories

Identify valuable memories to store for future agents' benefit

## Task

I'll find and commit beneficials memories to openmemory.

## Process

1. Review recent github issues, diffs, and PRs
2. Review recent work log entries in CLAUDE.md
3. Think about your experience working in this project, errors you resolved, edge cases you encountered
4. Identify anything you feel could be useful for a future agent to know when they start
5. Commit those memories to openmemory

I'll commit memories to openmemory if I identify any I feel could be useful
