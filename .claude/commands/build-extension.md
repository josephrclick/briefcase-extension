# Build Extension

Build the Chrome extension for production, ensuring all packages are compiled and the manifest is properly configured.

## Task

I'll build the Briefcase Chrome extension with all dependencies and create a production-ready build.

## Process

1. Install all dependencies if needed
2. Build all workspace packages
3. Compile TypeScript files
4. Bundle the extension with proper manifest
5. Verify the build output

I'll ensure the build is optimized for Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
