### 2025-08-25 - Implement Readability.js Content Extraction (Issue #14)

- **Implemented Core Content Extraction**:
  - Added @mozilla/readability as dependency to packages/extractor
  - Replaced basic DOM traversal with robust Readability.js implementation
  - Properly clones DOM to avoid modifying live page content
  - Returns ExtractedPayload with title, rawText, url, site, wordCount, and sections
  - Handles extraction failures gracefully by returning null
- **Added Test Infrastructure**:

  - Installed vitest, @vitest/ui, and happy-dom for testing
  - Created comprehensive unit tests covering success and failure cases
  - Updated tsconfig.json to include test files
  - All tests passing (4/4)

- **Outcome**: Created PR [#21](https://github.com/josephrclick/briefcase-extension/pull/21) for review
