### 2025-08-25 - Work Log Update Automation (Issue #7)

- **Implemented Automated Work Log Updates**:

  - Created `.claude/scripts/update-worklog.sh` to manage CLAUDE.md updates
  - Modified git workflow commands to automatically update work log:
    - `git-start`: Sets current branch when creating new feature
    - `git-switch`: Updates branch indicator when switching
    - `git-review`: Adds work log entry and resets to main after PR
  - Added structured "Current Branch" indicator to CLAUDE.md
  - Fixed sed escaping issue for branch names containing slashes
  - Created comprehensive documentation in `.claude/WORKLOG_AUTOMATION.md`
  - Added CI verification workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-worklog.yml`) to ensure:
    - Work log structure remains valid
    - Update scripts are executable
    - Branch updates work correctly
  - Successfully tested all automation features

- **Root Cause Analysis**:

  - No automation existed - all updates were manual
  - No git hooks configured for branch events
  - Git workflow commands didn't interact with CLAUDE.md

- **Solution Approach**:
  - Hybrid approach: dedicated update script + workflow integration
  - Avoided git hooks to reduce setup complexity
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflows
