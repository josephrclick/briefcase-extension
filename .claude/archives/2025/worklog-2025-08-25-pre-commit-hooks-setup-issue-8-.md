### 2025-08-25 - Pre-commit Hooks Setup (Issue #8)

- **Implemented Pre-commit Hooks with Husky and lint-staged**:

  - Installed lint-staged as dev dependency in monorepo root
  - Initialized Husky with `npx husky init` to create `.husky/` directory
  - Created `.lintstagedrc.json` configuration:
    - Runs Prettier and ESLint on JS/TS files
    - Runs Prettier on JSON, MD, CSS, HTML files
    - Configured for monorepo structure (root-level execution)
  - Updated `.husky/pre-commit` hook to run `npx lint-staged`
  - Fixed Husky v9 deprecation warning in commit-msg hook
  - Successfully tested with intentionally malformed files
  - Pre-commit hooks now automatically format and lint staged files

- **Key Features**:

  - Prevents formatting issues from reaching CI (like in PR #5)
  - Only processes staged files for fast execution
  - Automatically fixes and stages formatting corrections
  - Works seamlessly with monorepo structure
  - Integrated with existing commitlint setup

- **Note**: Encountered ESM/CommonJS conflict with commitlint.config.js that needs separate resolution
